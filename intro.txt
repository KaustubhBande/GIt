Intro :
==========================================================
My Name is Kaustubh Bande. My Father's Name is Dilip and and My Mother's Name is Jyotsna and she is a House maker.
My Father is a Govt Employee due to which we had to move around alot which broke my Schooling into pieces.
I completed my 10th scoring 88% and 12th with 83%.

I've completed Graduation from Govt College of Engineering, Amravati scoring a CGPA of 7.99. I have also done 
Diploma in Fitness Sciences. There after I worked as a Fitness Instructor in a renowned Fitness Franchize until

took Admission in C-DAC Kharghar. And I'm currently pursuing Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing. 
That's my Educational Background.

I work in  a very Organised manner and I don't find mixing with a bunch of people an obstacle. Although I don't 
show it but I hate it when people don't value time and aren't puntual. One more quality of mine which at times can be
a weakness is I like being a perfectionist.

Apart from Academics, I'm highly interested in Philosphy and Psychology. And as you may have 
guessed already, I am a Fitness Enthusiast. I read Books in my free time. Although I like to read Sci-Fi and 
Self-Help Books but, I like Suspense thrillers the most. Also, I like to be with Nature whenever I can and 
I absolutely Love watching Movies and Series.

My immediate Goal is to be Proficient in all the technologies that are being taught in PG-DAC and also improve upon my 
Communication skills; mainly to be fluent in Spoken English and some of my long term goals are to be financially independent, 
jaunt arond the world, fly a Plane, take some sort of formal education in Philosophhy and Psychology, learn how to play Piano, 
to build a Self-Sustaining house , and may be write a book or two.
My immediate goal is to get a job and start earning as early as possible and..
